# NLP Task Project

This project focuses on natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as tokenization and sequence processing using Python and Keras.

## Overview

This repository contains code for various NLP tasks implemented using Python and Keras. It includes functionalities for tokenizing text data, sequence processing using recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and more.

## Project Structure

- **`data/`**: Contains sample data files.
- **`models/`**: Stores trained models.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for experimentation and training.
- **`scripts/`**: Utility scripts for data preprocessing and model evaluation.
- **`requirements.txt`**: List of Python dependencies.
- **`README.md`**: Project overview, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.

## Usage

1. **Installation**: Clone the repository and install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abhik4004/nullclass_internship_training.git
   cd NullClass
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Data Preparation**: Prepare your data and place it in the `data/` directory.

3. **Training**: Use the provided scripts or notebooks in `notebooks/` to train models on your data.

4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using scripts from `scripts/`.
