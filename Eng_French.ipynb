    "For our machine translation project, we opt for a dataset featuring a limited vocabulary, specifically designed to facilitate a more manageable and efficient training process. Unlike the extensive [WMT](http://www.statmt.org/) datasets, our chosen dataset ensures a quicker training time and demands fewer computational resources. This strategic decision aims to balance the learning experience while still achieving meaningful results within practical time constraints.\n",

    "By examining the sentences, it's apparent that they have undergone preprocessing: punctuation has been delimited with spaces, and all the text has been converted to lowercase. This preprocessing serves a crucial purpose in text preparation. Firstly, delimiting punctuation with spaces ensures that each punctuation mark is treated as a separate token, aiding the model in understanding sentence structure. Secondly, converting the entire text to lowercase standardizes the input, preventing the model from distinguishing between words solely based on their casing. This uniformity facilitates more effective training and generalization, enhancing the model's ability to grasp patterns and generate accurate translations."
